      # IssuedCardState - The `state` represents the operational status of an issued card. A card can only approve incoming authorizations if it is in an active state.
      #
      # - `active`: The card is operational and approves authorizations. Generally becomes active shortly after card creation.
      # - `inactive`: The card cannot approve authorizations. This is currently a temporary state assigned post-creation during the activation process.
      # - `closed`: The card is permanently deactivated and cannot approve authorizations. A card can be closed by request or when it expires.
      # - `pending-verification`: Awaiting additional authorized user verification before the card can be activated.
